## ✨ Features

- **🚀 29+ GCP Services**: Support for Compute Engine, GKE, Bigtable, Pub/Sub, Storage, Cloud SQL, Vertex AI, Artifact Registry, and more.
- **🖥️ Embedded Dashboard**: Real-time observability and resource management via a premium web UI.
- **🛠️ Terraform Ready**: First-class support for the official Google Cloud Terraform provider via custom endpoint routing.
- **🔌 Dynamic Registry**: Modular plugin system for community-led service contributions.
- **📦 Single Binary**: Developed entirely in Go. A single, ultra-lightweight binary where all services are lazy-loaded for maximum efficiency and sub-100ms startup times.

## 📋 Prerequisites
MiniSky requires the following tools installed and running on your local machine:
- **[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)**: Used for high-fidelity service emulation (Compute, SQL, etc.).
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**: Required for installation and plugin management.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

**Linux & macOS:**
```bash
curl -sSL https://minisky.bmics.com.ng/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows — Direct Download (Recommended):**

Download the self-contained `minisky.exe` from the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/qamarudeenm/minisky/releases/latest). No installer needed — just extract and run:

```powershell
# Download and extract
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/qamarudeenm/minisky/releases/latest/download/minisky_windows_amd64.zip -OutFile minisky.zip
Expand-Archive minisky.zip -DestinationPath C:\minisky

# Run
C:\minisky\minisky.exe start
```

> MiniSky stores all data in `%USERPROFILE%\.minisky\` — never in your working directory.

**Windows — Scoop (Alternative):**

```powershell
# Install Scoop if not already installed
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri https://get.scoop.sh | Invoke-Expression

# Install MiniSky
scoop bucket add minisky https://github.com/qamarudeenm/scoop-bucket
scoop install minisky
```

### Start the Daemon
```bash
minisky start
```
- **API Gateway**: `http://localhost:8080`
- **Dashboard**: `http://localhost:8081`

### Uninstall
```bash
minisky uninstall
```
This removes all containers, networks, and data from `~/.minisky`. Then delete the binary to fully uninstall.

## 🖥️ Platform Compatibility

MiniSky is cross-platform, but some features have varying support levels:

| Feature | Linux | macOS | Windows (Native) | Windows (WSL2/Docker) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| GKE / Compute / Storage | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Pub/Sub / Cloud SQL | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| BigQuery SQL Execution | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ (Mock) | ✅ |
| **CGO Required** | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |

> **Note**: Native Windows builds use a `CGO_DISABLED=1` configuration for maximum portability. This means BigQuery SQL execution is mocked. For full high-fidelity BigQuery emulation on Windows, we recommend running MiniSky via **Docker Desktop** or **WSL2**.
